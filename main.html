<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
<p>Time complexity is a way to measure how the runtime of an algorithm grows with input size. 
	It helps evaluate how efficient an algorithm is in terms of speed. 
	Efficient algorithms have lower time complexities (like O(n) or O(log n)), making them faster and more scalable. 
	Choosing the right algorithm can greatly improve performance.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. 
		When an algorithm has O(n) space complexity, it means the memory usage grows linearly with the input size. For example, 
		storing all elements of an input array or creating a new array of the same size would require O(n) space. 
		Efficient memory usage is crucial for handling large data.
